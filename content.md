# CSC-9010: Cloud Native Development
Capstone Project and Course Summary
Villanova University - Spring 2025


# Capstone Project Outcome

## Successes and Complexities

*   Everything worked (eventually!)
*   I was stuck with some of the out-of-date instructions, but it was a good oportunity to troubleshoot, like I would do if I were a cloud engineer.
*   The Villanova access policy was annoying, but used a personal Azure account and mobile hotspot in-class to circumvent it.
*   Getting an actual app hosted in the cloud was a really good feeling.

## How much were I able to accomplish and deploy?

*   I was able to accomplish all the areas we covered!
*   Deployed insfrastructure with Terraform.
*   Running containers registered in ACR.
*   Publicly-available endpoints returning live data.


# Course Feedback

## What I liked & what didn't work well

*   Liked the focus on Azure instead of splitting time between the three major providers.
*   Least liked the amount of time spent with terraform (but that's probably because I'm a developer and not a cloud engineer...)

## Did the course meet my expectations?

*   Yes!
*   Wanted to get familiar with the ins and outs of Azure
*   Hoped to get experience deploying an app

## Recommendations for improvement

*   Integrate taking the AZ-900 exam with the course. (Like HS AP courses do with their exams)
