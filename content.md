# Final presentation

1. Capstone Project Outcome

Successes and Complexities - what worked, where were you stuck, etc.
- Everything worked (eventually!)
- I was stuck with some of the out-of-date instructions, but it was a good oportunity to troubleshoot, like I would do if I were a cloud engineer.
- The Villanova access policy was annoying, but used a personal Azure account to circumvent it.


How much were you able to accomplish and deploy - Infrastructure, Container Images, Instances of Running Containers, API Management, Connection to SQL Server, and Connection of Microservices to API Management.
- I was able to accomplish all the areas we covered!
- Deployed insfrastructure with Terraform
- Running containers registered in ACR
- APIM endpoints




2. Your Feedback on the Course:

What you liked & what didn't work well
- I liked the focus on Azure instead of splitting time between the three major providers.
- Personally, the thing I liked least was the amount of time spent with terraform, but that's probably because I'm a developer and not a cloud engineer.

Did the course meet your expectations, why or why not?
- Yes! 
- Wanted to get familiar with the ins and outs of Azure
- Wanted experience deploying an app

Any other recommendations you would suggest that could improve the course
- Integrate taking the AZ-900 exam with the course. (Like HS AP courses do with their exams) There are no textbook fees, so I think that's a reasonable cost.
